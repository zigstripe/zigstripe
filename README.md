# Hello there, ZigStripe is here, welcome to this place!

I’m a computer science tech who codes *once in a while*.

Most of the time I deal with other stuff, but sometimes coding comes to the rescue... 
This place is where I drop my random projects, tests, and experiments.  

---

## 🔧 What I use (when I code, if i ever do)

- 🐍 Python → my go-to for scripts and small tools  
- 🐘 PHP → enough to build things both procedural and OOP  
- 🔵 C → mostly small exercises, still learning  
- 🌐 HTML & 🎨 CSS → just the basics, nothing fancy  

Tools I like:  
- VS Code
- Git + GitHub  

---

## 📂 Projects
Not much to see yet, it's so damn empty...  
But if you’re here, expect a mix of experiments, half-finished ideas, and maybe something useful.
Don't expect profesional things and serious projects, at least here.

## 🦨 Some facts about me
- I prefer simple solutions over complex ones  
- I learn what I need, when I need it
- I use Arch, btw
